# Bot-Detection-System
Say goodbye to traditional CAPTCHA! I have built an Bot Detection System that uses Machine Learning to distinguish between humans and bots—offering a seamless and more secure experience for users.

## What This Project Does:
Instead of using traditional CAPTCHAs, this system leverages AI and behavioral analysis to determine whether a user is a bot or a real human. It’s designed to be easily integrated into any application via an API, 
making it a flexible security solution for businesses.

## Project Overview:
- **AI-Based Bot Detection** – Replaces traditional CAPTCHA with a ML model to detect bots with high accuracy.
- **API-First Approach** – Designed as a product that clients can easily integrate by making API calls.
- **Unique API Key Authentication** – Each client gets a unique API key to access the bot detection service.
- **Fast & User-Friendly** – No frustrating image puzzles; detection happens in the background, improving UX.

## How It Works:
1. **User Interacts with a Website/App** – When a user submits a form or performs an action, a request is sent to our system.
2. **AI Analyzes User Behavior** – The model examines factors like request patterns, interaction timing, and metadata to detect bot-like behavior.
3. **Prediction & Response** – The API returns a simple response indicating whether the user is a bot or human.
4. **Client System Takes Action** – Based on the result, the client can allow, block, or ask for additional verification.

## Key Features:
- **AI-Powered Detection** – Uses behavioral analysis and request fingerprinting for bot detection.
- **Easy API Integration** – Clients can integrate it into their system using a simple API call.
- **Secure & Scalable** – API authentication ensures secure usage with unique API keys for each client.
- **Frictionless User Experience** – No need for annoying CAPTCHA challenges—transparent bot filtering.
